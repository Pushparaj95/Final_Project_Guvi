## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative using a deep learning model. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Real-time review predictions

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the IMDB Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. It contains two columns:
- `review`: The text of the review
- `sentiment`: The sentiment label (`positive` or `negative`)

---

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:
1. Cleaning the text (removing special characters, links, etc.)
2. Tokenizing and lemmatizing the text
3. Removing stopwords
4. Padding sequences to a fixed length

---

## Model Architecture

The model is an LSTM-based neural network with the following layers:
- Embedding layer
- LSTM layer with 2 layers and dropout
- Fully connected layer
- Sigmoid activation for binary classification

---

## Training and Validation

- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: 5
- **Batch Size**: 32

The model was trained on 80% of the data, with 10% used for validation.

---

## Evaluation

The model achieved an accuracy of **88%** on the test dataset. Below is the confusion matrix for the test data:

## Insights

1. **Review Length Distribution**:
    - Positive reviews have an average length of 232 words.
    - Negative reviews have an average length of 229 words.

2. **Model Performance**:
    - The model performs well on both positive and negative reviews, with minimal misclassifications.

3. **Real-Time Predictions**:
    - The model can predict sentiments for new reviews with high accuracy.

## Final Model Review Predictions

Here are some real-time predictions made by the model:
![Model Predictions](screenshots/model_predictions.jpg)

| Review | Actual Sentiment | Predicted Sentiment | Confidence Score |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| "Acting was trash, literally no plot whatsoever..." | Negative | Negative üò´ | 0.05 |
| "I can't agree with the negative reviews on here..." | Positive | Positive üòÑ | 0.85 |
| "The Lion King (1994) is my favorite Disney movie..." | Negative | Negative üò§ | 0.25 |
| "I absolutely love this movie, and I'm giving it..." | Positive | Positive üòç | 0.95 |
